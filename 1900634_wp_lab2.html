            <p>An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) (or uncrewed aerial vehicle
                ,[2] commonly known as a drone) is an aircraft without
                 a human pilot on board and a type of unmanned vehicle
                 . UAVs are a component of an unmanned aircraft system (UAS)
                 ; which include a UAV, a ground-based controller
                 , and a system of communications between the two.
                 [3] The flight of UAVs may operate with various degrees of autonomy
                 : either under remote control by a human operator, autonomously by 
                 onboard computers [4] or piloted by an autonomous robot.[5]
                 Compared to crewed aircraft, UAVs were originally used for missions
                  too "dull, dirty or dangerous"[6] for humans. While they originated
                   mostly in military applications, their use is rapidly expanding to
                    commercial, scientific,[7][8][9][10] recreational, agricultural
                    , and other applications,[11] such as policing and surveillance
                    , product deliveries, aerial photography, infrastructure inspections
                    , smuggling,[12] and drone racing. Civilian UAVs now vastly outnumber 
                    military UAVs, with estimates of over a million sold by 2015.

            <h3 id="terminology">Terminology</h3>
            <p>Multiple terms are used for unmanned aerial vehicles, which generally refer to the same concept.<br>
                The term drone, more widely used by the public, was coined in reference to the early 
                remotely-flown target aircraft used for practice firing of a battleship's guns
                , and the term was first used with the 1920s Fairey Queen and 1930's de Havilland 
                Queen Bee target aircraft. These two were followed in service by the similarly named 
                Airspeed Queen Wasp and Miles Queen Martinet, before ultimate replacement by the GAF 
                Jindivik.[13] The term unmanned aircraft system (UAS) was adopted by the United 
                States Department of Defense (DoD) and the United States Federal Aviation 
                Administration in 2005 according to their Unmanned Aircraft System Roadmap 2005–2030.[14] 
                The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the British Civil Aviation 
                Authority adopted this term, also used in the European Union's Single-European-Sky (SES) 
                Air-Traffic-Management (ATM) Research (SESAR Joint Undertaking) roadmap for 2020.[15] 
                This term emphasizes the importance of elements other than the aircraft. It includes 
                elements such as ground control stations, data links and other support equipment. 
                A similar term is an unmanned-aircraft vehicle system (UAVS), remotely piloted aerial 
                vehicle (RPAV), remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS).[16] Many similar terms are in 
                use. A UAV is defined as a "powered, aerial vehicle that does not carry a human operator, 
                uses aerodynamic forces to provide vehicle lift, can fly autonomously or be piloted 
                remotely, can be expendable or recoverable, and can carry a lethal or nonlethal 
                payload".[17] Therefore, missiles are not considered UAVs because the vehicle itself is a 
                weapon that is not reused, though it is also uncrewed and in some cases remotely guided. 
                That being said, UAV is a term that is commonly applied to military use cases.[18]
                The terms autonomous drone and UAV are often wrongfully used interchangeably. 
                This could stem from the fact that many UAVs are automated, i.e. they carry 
                out automated missions but still rely on human operators. However, an autonomous 
                drone is a "UAV that can operate without any human intervention".[19] In other words, 
                autonomous drones take off, carry out missions, and land completely autonomously. 
                Thus, an autonomous drone is a type of UAV but a UAV is not necessarily an autonomous 
                drone. As autonomous drones are not piloted by humans, a ground control system, 
                or communications management software, plays a major role in their operations, 
                and thus they are also considered part of a UAS. In addition to the software, 
                autonomous drones also employ a host of advanced technologies that allow them 
                to carry out their missions without human intervention, such as cloud computing, 
                computer vision, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, 
                and thermal sensors.[20] In recent years, autonomous drones have begun to 
                transform various commercial industries as they can fly beyond visual line of 
                sight (BVLOS)[21] while maximizing production, reducing costs and risks, 
                ensuring site safety, security and regulatory compliance,[22] and protecting 
                the human workforce in times of a pandemic.[23] They can also be used for 
                consumer-related missions like package delivery, as demonstrated by Amazon 
                Prime Air, and critical deliveries of health supplies.
                A Drone-in-a-Box (DIB) is an autonomous drone that deploys to carry out a 
                pre-programmed list of missions from and returns to a self-contained landing box, 
                which also functions as the drone's charging base. Under new regulations which 
                came into effect 1 June 2019, the term RPAS (Remotely Piloted Aircraft System) 
                has been adopted by the Canadian Government to mean "a set of configurable 
                elements consisting of a remotely piloted aircraft, its control station, the 
                command and control links and any other system elements required during flight 
                operation".[24] The relation of UAVs to remote controlled model aircraft is 
                unclear.[citation needed] UAVs may or may not include model aircraft. Some 
                jurisdictions base their definition on size or weight; however, the US Federal 
                Aviation Administration defines any uncrewed flying craft as a UAV regardless of 
                size. For recreational uses, a drone (as opposed to a UAV) is a model aircraft 
                that has first-person video, autonomous capabilities, or both.[25]

            <p>The Israeli Tadiran Mastiff, which first flew in 1975, is seen by many as the first modern 
                battlefield UAV, due to its data-link system, endurance-loitering, and live video-streaming.
            </p>
            <p>The earliest attempt at a powered UAV was A. M. Low's "Aerial Target" in 
                1916.[36] Nikola Tesla described a fleet of uncrewed aerial combat vehicles 
                in 1915.[37] Advances followed during and after World War I, including the 
                British Hewitt-Sperry Automatic Airplane (1917) and the RAE Larynx (1927). 
                These developments also inspired the construction of the Kettering Bug by 
                Charles Kettering from Dayton, Ohio. Initially meant as an uncrewed plane 
                that would carry an explosive payload to a predetermined target. The first 
                scaled remote piloted vehicle was developed by film star and model-airplane 
                enthusiast Reginald Denny in 1935.[36] More emerged during World War II – 
                used both to train antiaircraft gunners and to fly attack missions. Nazi 
                Germany produced and used various UAV aircraft during the war, like the Argus 
                As 292 and the V-1 flying bomb with a Jet engine. After World War II the 
                development continued in vehicles such as the American JB-4 
                (using television/radio-command guidance), the Australian GAF Jindivik and 
                Teledyne Ryan Firebee I of 1951, while companies like Beechcraft offered their
                 Model 1001 for the U.S. Navy in 1955.[36] Nevertheless, they were little more 
                 than remote-controlled airplanes until the Vietnam War.
            </p>
            <p>In 1959, the U.S. Air Force, concerned about losing pilots over hostile 
                territory, began planning for the use of uncrewed aircraft.[38] Planning 
                intensified after the Soviet Union shot down a U-2 in 1960. Within days, 
                a highly classified UAV program started under the code name of "Red Wagon".
                [39] The August 1964 clash in the Tonkin Gulf between naval units of the 
                U.S. and North Vietnamese Navy initiated America's highly classified UAVs 
                (Ryan Model 147, Ryan AQM-91 Firefly, Lockheed D-21) into their first 
                combat missions of the Vietnam War.[40] When the Chinese government[41] 
                showed photographs of downed U.S. UAVs via Wide World Photos,[42] the 
                official U.S. response was "no comment".
            </p>
            <p>During the War of Attrition (1967–1970) the first tactical UAVs installed 
                with reconnaissance cameras were first tested by the Israeli intelligence, 
                successfully bringing photos from across the Suez canal. This was the first 
                time that tactical UAVs, which could be launched and landed on any short 
                runway (unlike the heavier jet-based UAVs), were developed and tested in 
                battle.
            </p>
            <p>In the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Israel used UAVs as decoys to spur opposing 
                forces into wasting expensive anti-aircraft missiles.[44] After the 1973 
                Yom Kippur war, a few key people from the team that developed this early 
                UAV joined a small startup company that aimed to develop UAVs into a 
                commercial product, eventually purchased by Tadiran and leading to the 
                development of the first Israeli UAV.
            </p>
            <p>In 1973, the U.S. military officially confirmed that they had been using 
                UAVs in Southeast Asia (Vietnam).[46] Over 5,000 U.S. airmen had been 
                killed and over 1,000 more were missing or captured. The USAF 100th 
                Strategic Reconnaissance Wing flew about 3,435 UAV missions during the 
                war[47] at a cost of about 554 UAVs lost to all causes. In the words of USAF 
                General George S. Brown, Commander, Air Force Systems Command, in 1972, 
                "The only reason we need (UAVs) is that we don't want to needlessly expend 
                the man in the cockpit."[48] Later that year, General John C. Meyer, 
                Commander in Chief, Strategic Air Command, stated, "we let the drone do 
                the high-risk flying ... the loss rate is high, but we are willing to risk 
                more of them ...they save lives!"
            </p>
            <p>During the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Soviet-supplied surface-to-air missile 
                batteries in Egypt and Syria caused heavy damage to Israeli fighter jets. 
                As a result, Israel developed the first UAV with real-time surveillance.
                [49][50][51] The images and radar decoys provided by these UAVs helped 
                Israel to completely neutralize the Syrian air defenses at the start of 
                the 1982 Lebanon War, resulting in no pilots downed.[52] The first time 
                UAVs were used as proof-of-concept of super-agility post-stall controlled 
                flight in combat-flight simulations involved tailless, stealth 
                technology-based, three-dimensional thrust vectoring flight control, 
                jet-steering UAVs in Israel in 1987.[53]
            </p>
            <p>With the maturing and miniaturization of applicable technologies in the 
                1980s and 1990s, interest in UAVs grew within the higher echelons of the 
                U.S. military. In the 1990s, the U.S. DoD gave a contract to AAI 
                Corporation along with Israeli company Malat. The U.S. Navy bought the 
                AAI Pioneer UAV that AAI and Malat developed jointly. Many of these UAVs 
                saw service in the 1991 Gulf War. UAVs demonstrated the possibility of 
                cheaper, more capable fighting machines, deployable without risk to 
                aircrews. Initial generations primarily involved surveillance aircraft, 
                but some carried armaments, such as the General Atomics MQ-1 Predator, 
                that launched AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles.
            </p>
            <p>CAPECON was a European Union project to develop UAVs,[54] running 
                from 1 May 2002 to 31 December 2005.[55]
            </p>
            <p>As of 2012, the USAF employed 7,494 UAVs – almost one in three 
                USAF aircraft.[56][57] The Central Intelligence Agency also operated UAVs.
            </p>
            <p>In 2013 at least 50 countries used UAVs. China, Iran, 
                Israel, Pakistan, and others designed and built their own varieties.
